## Summary

Upon access the user will be greeted with a message, and will continue to see all listed departments in one place. There is currently one filter option with which the user can limit the search to any *ONE* desired keyword.

The admin panel (/index & /portal) allows for CRUD operations:
* Get
* Post
* Delete
* Update

The panel's purpose is to allow for admin users to see & operate the site independently from what the front-end user sees. The common user should not have access to those editing functions.
